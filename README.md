# Image Grid Generator
 Generate a random grid of images from a folder of images. Includes a handy web interface!

## Quick Backstory
 I needed this in 2016 when I was making a large mosaic photo comprised of a bunch of little photos. So I wrote this little thing.
 
## How To Use
 First, place all the photos ou want to use in images folder. Then, run the `init.sh` script. This creates the `srcURLs.js` file, which contains the URLs of every image. Then run `imageGrid.html`. From here, the web interface should be intuitive and self-explanatory.
